<h2>A Quick Overview of the Gibthon Construct Designer (GCD)</h2>

<p>
As you can see, we've made a few changes to the GCD.
</p>
<p>
Here's a quick walkthrough of how to use the new version and a few hints as to
what's in the works.
</p>

<h4>1) Import the required fragments into gibthon</h4>

<div class='walkthrough-item'>

    <p>
    Fragments can be imported from various sources including NCBI entrez and a
    number of file formats in the `fragment' app.
    </p>
</div>

<h4>2) Crop the fragments to the region of interest</h4>

<div class='walkthrough-item'>
    <p>
    Fragments can be cropped in the fragment view, in the `fragment' app.
    </p>
    <p>
    We're currently developing a way of selecting regions within fragments from the
    gibthon app itself.
    This would eliminate the need for this step and the extra fragments it
    generates. See issue BLAH.
    </p>
</div>

<h4>3) Drag and Drop</h4>

<div class='walkthrough-item'>
    <p>
    Drag and drop the fragments into their correct order in the Construct Designer
    </p>
</div>

<h4>4) Confirm settings</h4>

<div class='walkthrough-item'>
    <p>
    Enter the settings for the reaction(s) in the settings tab
    </p>
</div>

<h4>5) Process</h4>

<div class='walkthrough-item'>
    <p>
    Click process to design your primers
    </p>
</div>

<h4>6) Download Protocols and View Warnings</h4>

<div class='walkthrough-item'>
    <p>
    Warnings are displayed whenever gibthon detects a potential problem with your
    primers.
    Often these warnings will not affect the outcome of the reaction, but judgement
    is required as to the severity of the problem.
    </p>
    <p>
    We're working on a method for manually adjusting the length of the primers in
    order to avoid warnings
    as well as a general improvement of the way these primers are displayed.
    Being able to see that your primers are sane at a glance is a key design
    goal. See issue BLARG!!
