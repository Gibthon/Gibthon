		<p>Before you can start to put together a construct, you must first collect a library of parts.
		In the Gibthon Construct Designer, these are known as 'Fragments'.</p>
		<p>These are all stored within the GCD, to speed up access and improve reliability. Currently
		three data sources are supported:</p>
		<table style="width:100%;" class="protocol">
			<tr>
				<th style="width:10%;">Name</th>
				<th style="width:30%;">Registry of Standard Parts</th>
				<th style="width:30%;">Nucleotide Database</th>
				<th style="width:30%;">Upload</th>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td>Location</td>
				<td><a href="http://partsregistry.org/Main_Page">partsregistry.org</a></td>
				<td><a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/nuccore">www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/nuccore</a></td>
				<td>Your hard drive</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td>Description</td>
				<td>The Registry of Standard Biological Parts has been developed as a repository for
				the parts generated and used by <a href="http://ung.igem.org/">iGEM</a>.</td>
				<td>The Nucleotide Database is a collection of sequences run by the <a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/">NCBI</a></td>
				<td>Genbank format files that you have created yourself (eg from <a href="http://biologylabs.utah.edu/jorgensen/wayned/ape/">ApE</a></td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td>Identifier</td>
				<td>Part name (eg BBa_K190015 or pSB1C3)</td>
				<td>Locus (eg HD065425)</td>
				<td>Genbank Locus</td>
			</tr>
		</table>
		<p>Further data sources will be added in the future</p>
		<p>Once you have added your fragments, you will be able to add a brief description
		and delete them.</p>
	</div>
	<div id="designer">
		<p>Now you have amassed a library of parts, you can start to design constructs.</p>
		<p>In your <a href="/gibthon/">Construct Library</a>, add a new construct or open an existing one.</p>
		<p>When you open a construct, you are presented with four main areas:</p>
		<table style="width:100%;" class="protocol">
			<tr>
				<th style="width:50%;">
					Info
				</th>
				<th style="width:50%;">
					Settings
				</th>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td>
					<p>Here you can view the name and description of the construct. To edit this information,
					just click the edit button.</p>
				</td>
				<td>
					<p>Here you can view the settings associated with this construct. To edit them, click the edit
					button.</p>
					<p>More info on what the settings do is in the next tab</p>
				</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<th>
					Fragments
				</th>
				<th>
					Summary
				</th>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td>
					<p>This is where you will do they bulk of your editing. Click on a fragment to expand it.
					You may add, remove, browse and reorder fragments. From each fragment, you may choose a
					start and end feature that you wish to extract.</p>
				</td>
				<td>
					<p>This area contains a summary of your construct so far</p>
				</td>
			</tr>
		</table>
		<p></p>
		<p>Once you have designed your construct, you may save and download it in GenBank format from the menubar at the top.</p>
		<p>To generate the primers, just click process on the menubar at the top</p>

	</div>
	<div id="primers">
		<p>Once they are generated, selecting 'View Primers' will allow you to see your primers in
		more detail. Any warnings generated from their design can be seen here. These warnings fall into three 
		categories</p>
		<ul>
			<li>T<sub>m</sub> warning: the annealing temperature of either the annealing portion or the whole primer 
			is less than the target</li>
			<li>Self prime warning: the primer could potentially prime to itself on the 3' end</li>
			<li>Misprime warning: the primer could potentially prime elsewhere on the fragment</li>
